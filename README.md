# TFX Kubeflow pipelines
Kubeflow pipelines built on top of Tensorflow TFX library

## General info
This repository contains machine learning pipelines based on Tensorflow TFX library.
Every pipeline is designed to be published on a Kubernetes/Kubeflow cluster *on premise*.

### Tutorials
Each folder contains needed code and data for the Kubeflow Pipeline, plus a README that includes:

* pipeline general information
* specific Kubernetes resources setup instructions
* specific data handling about pipeline on premise

Further pipelines are welcome via pull request.
